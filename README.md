# RetroArch-problematic-cheevos

## UPDATE: after the latest RetroArch fixes (01/Nov/2016) many of these problematic cheevos are already solved!

A place to put the savestates of games with cheevos problems when running in RetroArch and no problems in "oficial" emulators.

### The idea of this repository is to provide useful savestates to help RetroArch developers solve problems with achievements that don't work in RetroArch AND work fine in the oficial RetroAchievements.org emulators. Only this!

The structure is:

- directory with Name-Of-The-Game-SYSTEM.
  - README.txt: describing the problems with the achievements and describing the savestates
  - *.state: the files with the states saved right before the problematic achievement. No need to rename the state! Let the name the file gets from RetroArch (usually "Name of ROM.state")


## Notes / Changelog

- **2016-Nov-10**: The @grenade44 sent some Super Mario Land (Game Boy) savestates, saved with gambatte. I tested and it didn't work.

- **2016-Nov-06**: The @Soschu1 sent a Demon's Crest (SNES) save. ~~I tested with snes9x2010 core and didn't work. He said it worked with RASNES.~~ I tested with the save and it didn't work, and then I tested playing the game from the start and got the cheevo normally. So, **we are assuming that RetroArch is OK.**

- **2016-Nov-05**: The Metroid cheevos currently (6/November/2016) work with the QuickNES core only.

- **2016-Nov-01**: The Castlevania, Double Dragon, Felix the Cat (NES) cheevos problems were all solved after the fixes **Probably most of the problematic cheevos were solved**.
